# Playing with Context

This project was created using `create-react-app`.

The focus of this project is to have some fun with the new React Context API (new as of React 16.3alpha). 

## Findings

This new API is great.

* It saves time on passing props 3 or 4 levels deep, and keeps all state as high as possible.
* It emulates how Redux keeps state out of the natural flow of the component tree and stores it all in one place.
* Any `setState` methods all go into one object, along with any default values of state

## Next Steps

As I play around with this more and more, I'll be sure to see what other things I can do with it.
